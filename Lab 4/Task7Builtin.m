%Task 7: Using Built-in Functions
%Use MATLAB's built-in functions like max, min, and sum in a script.
%Create a vector of numbers and apply these functions to it.
%Submission: Prepare a MATLAB script that includes your solutions to the tasks above. Save the script as a .m file and submit it. Be sure to include comments to explain your code.
vec = [1 2 3 4 5];
numMax = max(vec);
numMin = min(vec);
numSum = sum(vec);
disp(numMax);
disp(numMin);
disp(numSum);
